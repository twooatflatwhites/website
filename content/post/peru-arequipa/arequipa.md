Arequipa is a stunning colonial city nestled in the Andes under the backdrop of Misti volcano. The Spanish influence here has influenced the city massively and is probably the most unique town we visited in Peru. We spent a few days wandering around this beautiful city and seeing what it had to offer.

## How long to stay

We'd recommend at least 2 days in the city, with a multi-day trip out to Colca Canyon (we didn't have time to do this unfortunately).

## What to do

- **Santa Catalina Monastery** - one of our favourite places in Arequipa, this monastery is still in use and has been preserved amazingly over the years. After you pay for entry, you can hire a guide inside the monastery which is highly recommended. It's worth waiting for a few more people to join your guide as you will pay a cheaper price.
  
- **Plaza de Armas** - visit the main square in Arequipa, I guarantee you will be absolutely blown away. Surrounded by colonial buildings and headed by the Basilica cathedral. There are plenty of balconies to enjoy a coffee or beer and watch the world go by.
  
- **Rafting in Rio Chili** - yep, colour me surprised too, but there is an amazing river just outside of the city to go rafting. This was my first time rafting and I had an absolute blast. The rafting we did here was level 3, so it was a reasonable challenge and had some really fun rapids to navigate.
  
- **[Free walking tour](https://www.freewalkingtourcondor.com/)** - take this free walking tour, there are departures at 10:00am, 15:00pm and 17:00pm every day in English. Our guide was fantastic and gave us a deep dive into the history and current state of Arequipa.
  
- **Colca Canyon** - we didn't have enough time to get out to Colca Canyon as you definitely need to do a multi-day trip to make the 6 hour journey (one way) worth your time. I'd highly recommend getting a local tour company to take you for a minimum of two days.

## Where to stay

We stayed in [Econunay hostel](https://www.hostelworld.com/st/hostels/p/101496/econunay/), social side wasn't amazing but it did the job for a few days.

## Where to eat

- **[Omphalos](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/omphalos-arequipa-85879)** - we found ourselves here nearly every day, the food was really good and crazy cheap.
  
- **[Prana vegan club](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/prana-vegan-arequipa-139878)** - great spot serving traditional Arequipan dishes, as well as burgers etc.
  
- **[El Buda Profano](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/el-buda-profano-arequipa-64990)** - we heard amazing things about this place, but it appeared to be closed when we wanted to visit. Hopefully it opens up again soon!
  

## Where to find great coffee

- **[Oso cafe](https://www.instagram.com/oso_cafe_arequipa/?hl=en)** - this was by far the best spot we found in Arequipa for a good coffee. The courtyard outside was a really nice spot for relaxing with a book.
