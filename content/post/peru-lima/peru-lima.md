**TLDR: Arrived in Lima, kicking off our Peru adventure with 3-4 days to explore. Highlights include a walking tour in the historic center, a coastal stroll from Miraflores to Barranco for a sunset view at Lover's Park, a street art hunt in Barranco with a visit to the Jade Rivera museum, indulging in traditional Peruvian dishes, a visit to the Larco Museum for pre-Colombian art and a unique sex exhibition, and the feline delights of Kennedy Park.üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåÖüç≤üèõÔ∏èüê±**
 
## The journey
After 16 hours of travel, we arrived in Peru to start our journey. We are here! We arrived in Lima (via Bogota) and it all went pretty smooth: no delays, nothing forgotten, bags are in Lima etc!
In a slight daze, we were both eager to get out and explore Lima, the entry point for most into Peru. From the second you leave the airport, there is the pure chaos of Latin America we experienced in Mexico - nothing and everything makes sense here; it's pure explosion of people and sounds.

## How long we stayed
3-4 nights is a good amount of time to explore Lima. We decided to slightly overstay our welcome just to get ourselves sorted and our heads into the South America time-zone!

## What we did
There's a lot to fill a few nights in Lima, here are some of our highlights:

- **Do a walking tour around around the historic center.** Most tours will begin in Miraflores and then teach you use the bus system as it's a bit complicated (you need a special card) and quite far from Miraflores/Barranco; it would take over 2 hours to walk! It's nice and worth doing, but not super exciting - a few statues and churches. It is however a great way to meet people - we met loads of people from our hostel who we became friends with and continued to hang out with. 
  
- **Take a stroll along the coast from Miraflores to Barranco.** The evening is a good time for this so you can watch the sunset over the pacific coast - we did this on a walking tour and ended in Lover's Park. Lover's Park is a central point on the coast of Lima and has a huge statue of a couple embracing - it's meant to be a good spot for romance but we wouldn't know about that...
  
- **Search for street art in Barranco.** We took ourselves for a walk around Barranco and when I say a walk I mean a coffee tour with some arty bits thrown in. We went to the mini Jade Rivera museum which we loved (he is a local graffiti artist). We bought a postcard with one of the pictures on of two kids with magnifying glasses and back packs ready to explore the universe; we chose this one because it felt poingyant for the beginning of our trip. We can't wait to display it at home as a marker of our travels!
  
- **Try some traditional Peruvian dishes.** There are some incredible restaurants here; supposedly the best in the world?! 
The first thing you need to understand about Peruvians is that they LOVE sweet food - two of the main traditional foods to try is Picarones (donuts made with sweet potato and covered in syrup - Picarones Mary is apparently the best spot and was featured in a Netflix documentary) and drink Chicha Morada (a sweet juice made from purple corn - super refreshing on a warm day). Peru is also one of the biggest exporters of avocados - we lived the millenial dream *e v e r y d a y*. 
However, our favourite thing about Peru's food was the link to China, meaning much of their traditional food is a fusion of Peru and China - Veggie lomo saltado was a core staple of our diet! 
  
- **Visit one of the best museums in South America and the world: The Larco museum.** An amazing collection of pre-Colombian art - we usually struggle with museums but enjoyed this one! It wasn't too long and there were interesting anthropological artifacts to look at over the Incan empire history. However, our two favourite things about it was the open storage collection (you never see this at any museum but it's just insane to see how much they have that isn't on display!) And the sex exhibition. Whilst it's super entertaining how crude some of the artifacts are (massive dicks, blow jobs, anal‚Ä¶ you name it and there's a statue of it), its also just great to see it's not brushed over; in modern times we shy away from sex, but it was always so central to historical culture.

- **Kennedy Park (aka cat park).** A park full of cats that are happy to be stroked, picked up and snuggled... what more could you want? If you go at the right time in the evening you can watch them having dinner!

## Where we stayed
We really enjoyed [Alpes Lima](https://www.hostelworld.com/st/hostels/p/277492/alpes-lima-kennedy-park/) located in the Miraflores district, we found the hostel had a great social vibe as well as great facilities, we made a few friends here too. They helped us purchase a SIM card when we arrive which was really handy.

## Where we ate
There are a huge amount of great veggie/vegan restaraunts in Lima, we didn't have the chance to try them all unfortunately. The ones we did try were all excellent:

- [Asianica Street Food](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/asianica-street-food-lima-315643) - This was our favourite spot in Lima, everything we had was excellent and the menu consists of lots of vegan-ised traditional Peruvian dishes which we really wanted to try.
  
- [Florencia - Vegan Kitchen](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/florencia-vegan-kitchen-lima-313927) - Another great spot in Barranco, the portions were very generous too!
  
- [Seitan Urban Bistro](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/seitan-urban-bistro-lima-70536) - Lots of traditional Peruvian dishes here made vegan!

## Where to find great coffee
There were four spots worth mentioning here that we tried:

- [Raiz Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/raiz.coffee/) - Funnily enough this cafe opened opposite our hostel the day we arrived. The coffee here is fantastic and the owner is really friendly. We ended up spending hours in here chatting and reading our books.
  
- [Milimertica Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/milimetricacoffee/) - Awesome spot in Miraflores, great food options too if I remember rightly!
  
- [Ciclos Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/cicloscafe/?hl=en) - Voted the best cafe in Lima in 2022 and it's easy to see why. An amazing selection of coffees on offer here tucked away in a really nice area of Barranco.
  
- [Cosmo Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/cosmo._______/) - seemingly another new addition to the Lima coffee scene, we had an amazing cold brew here.
