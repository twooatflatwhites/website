featuring unforgettable experiences like a private jungle tour in Manu National Park with Bonanza, an awe-inspiring visit to Machu Picchu, exploration of the Sacred Valley, and unique spots like Palccoyo Rainbow Mountain and Lake Humantay. Navigating the city by foot, we uncovered its charm and historical significance. Don&rsquo;t miss Cristo Blanco for a stunning view, even if it takes a couple of attempts! üèûÔ∏èüåÑ</strong></p><h2 id=the-journey>The journey</h2><p>The first thing when you arrive in Cusco is that you&rsquo;re hit with altitude - it&rsquo;s quite high here. We got into a taxi, arrived at our hostel and after climbing about 10 steps felt like we were going to faint. We have never felt like that before and it was hard to believe we would get used to it, but we did! We drank lots of coca tea which is made with coca leaves (which are the main ingredient of cocaine); this leaf is extremely important to Incan history and are sacred. It just makes you feel a bit more perky and helps with oxygen flow and therefore the altitude. You can drink it as tea or put leaves in your mouth to suck and get concentrated juice. I can&rsquo;t tell if it helps or if it&rsquo;s psychological but it seemed to do us some good!</p><h2 id=how-long-we-stayed>How long we stayed</h2><p>Depending on your time, you could spend anywhere from 3 days to 3 months in Cusco. We were in and around Cusco for just under 3 weeks, including our time out in Manu.</p><h2 id=what-we-did>What we did</h2><p>There&rsquo;s so much to do in Cusco city and outside of the city so it&rsquo;s impossible to do absolutely everything, but here is what we got up to:</p><ul><li><strong>Manu National Park, the Amazon.</strong> If you have the time and budget, do not miss out on experiencing the Amazon. Cancelled plans in Ecuador due to some political issues there, led us to <a class=link href=https://www.bonanzatoursperu.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Bonanza</a>; a family-run gem, where 25 years of passion for sustainable tourism won us over - they&rsquo;re a bit more expensive than other companies but worth it in our opinion (and everyone else we recommended them to!); and we were extremely lucky to have the tour all to ourselves for 5 days!
Our private jungle tour to Manu was a wild ride: a long drive through the cloud forest, a river boat adventure with a mid-journey river dip (no camens or piranhas here!), and a mesmerizing night on an observation deck surrounded by tapirs and the eerie calls of red howler monkeys. Jungle walks led us to massive monkey groups, insects, poisonous frogs, and countless birds. Surviving wasp encounters and a spiky fire bush added a touch of adventure.</li></ul><p>Sunset from an observation deck above the jungle canopy showcased more monkeys and birds before a freaky night walk to spot insects and reptiles. At sunrise we went back to the deck in search for macaws and toucans which proved successful, like it was orchestrated just for us. The return boat journey gifted us osprey sightings and refreshing river dips, thanks to the scorching heat.</p><p>Our favorite jungle companions were the monkeys, traveling in massive groups with adorable babies clinging to them. However, Oropendulas unintentionally became our tour mascots, earning the title of &ldquo;jungle pigeons&rdquo; due to their omnipresence.</p><p>Amidst hammock chill sessions, jungle hikes, and vegan feasts, the harsh reality of the Amazon&rsquo;s challenges hit home. Laughter and wildlife wonders couldn&rsquo;t drown out the echoes of chainsaws and jungle fires‚Äîa somber reminder of the urgent need to protect this beautiful place. Feeling extremely lucky and emotional, we cherished every moment of this extraordinary experience. üåøüêíüåÖ</p><ul><li><strong>Machu Picchu.</strong> No Cusco list would be complete without the obligatory Machu Picchu recommendation. There are a miriad of ways to get to Machu Picchu, you could trek for 4 days on the Salkantay or Inca trail, but we opted to catch the train after exploring the Sacred Valley.</li></ul><p>We stayed in touristy Aguas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu the night before and after our visit. A thunderstorm hit, knocking out power and internet, but we were thankful to have our Machu Picchu tickets.</p><p>We opted for the bus instead of a sweaty walk up the stairs to Machu Picchu, grabbing a guide in town after a bit of bargaining. Expensive, but worth it for the site&rsquo;s sparse information. Chose route 2 for both history and the iconic &ldquo;Machu Picchu picture.&rdquo; We learned that Machu Picchu&rsquo;s preservation secret was locals hiding it from the Spanish. An American rediscovered it but stirred controversy by allegedly looting valuables. Designated a wonder in 2006, it&rsquo;s a tad overpopulated but still impressively expected. The Andes stole the show with their breathtaking backdrop.</p><p>Descending through the jungle-like hill, we even spotted the national bird of Peru, the cock of the rock. The next day, we relaxed in hot springs before the train and bus journey back to Cusco. üèûÔ∏èüöÇ</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sacred Valley.</strong> Explored the sacred valley, a hub of Inca history. In Chinchero, a traditional town known for its alpaca products, we marveled at the weaving process showcased in a museum. Eye-wateringly expensive, but the craftsmanship deserves it! Explored Moray, a surprising Inca &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; with terraced levels for experimenting with light and altitude&rsquo;s impact on plants. Other stops included Maras salt mine (bought fancy salt for our sad hostel meals)and Ollytaytambo. Moray stole the show with its innovative history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Palccoyo Rainbow Mountain.</strong> Do this instead of the Vinicunca rainbow mountain (the one everyone goes to); more rainbow mountains and less walking!. When we visited Palccoyo there were very few tourists there and we were treated to some incedible scenery. Otherworldly!</p></li><li><p><strong>Lake Humantay.</strong> If you aren&rsquo;t doing the Salkantay trek, then visiting Lake Humantay is a must. The lake is beautiful - you&rsquo;re surrounded by snowcapped mountain and the lake itself is bright turquoise like nothing we&rsquo;ve ever seen. We were also lucky enough to have condors flying above!</p></li></ul><p>Lake Humantay is a glacier lake at an altitude of 4,600m meaning you need to complete a 300-400m climb at 4000m of elevation to see it, so bear that in mind! You can also grab a horse ride to the top if needed. We both found it quite challenging, but this was a particularly proud moment for Em who got pretty much all the way up there solo despite not being a hiker!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Explore the city by foot.</strong> The city is best explored by foot and is a great way to acclimatise yourself. There&rsquo;s charm around every corner in the city with plenty of independant artisanal shops, amazing restaraunts and narrow cobbly streets. We started with the usual walking tour to learn about the city - saw some ruins, got local insights on things to do and just generally learned about the history. Cusco was the capital and main centre point for the Incan empire so it holds a big significance - many of the buildings here are still in a traditional style of building.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cristo Blanco.</strong> As you&rsquo;re wandering around Cusco, you&rsquo;ll probably notice the white Christ statue overlooking the city, you can actually walk up to Cristo Blanco and enjoy an amazing view over the city. It took us 3 attempts to get up here - not because we struggled with the climb, but because we firstly ran into a collapsed stairway that blocked our path (great start!) and then a paywall (not paying to see stones to get to big jesus oh hell no). We decided to hang about until sunset and go later on our third and successful try!</p></li></ul><h2 id=where-we-stayed>Where we stayed</h2><p>As we were moving in and out of Cusco, we stayed in a few places. Our favourite was <a class=link href=https://www.bearpackerhostelcusco.com/en/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Bear Packer</a>, great social environment here (it was like mini northern England!) with good facitilies. Think I remember it being pretty cheap too!</p><h2 id=where-we-ate>Where we ate</h2><p>As is seemingly common in Peru, you&rsquo;re spoilt for choice:</p><ul><li><p><a class=link href=https://www.happycow.net/reviews/vida-vegan-bistro-cusco-86403 target=_blank rel=noopener>Vida Vegan Bistro</a> - whilst on the slight more expensive side, this is some of the best food we ate in all of Peru, highly recommended!</p></li><li><p><a class=link href=https://www.happycow.net/reviews/green-falafel-cusco-134205 target=_blank rel=noopener>Green Falafel</a> - really good, cheap falafel dishes here.</p></li><li><p><a class=link href=https://indian-restaurant-garhwal.negocio.site/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Indian Restaurant Garhwal</a> - we were absolutely not expecting to have Indian food this good in Peru, every dish was excellent.</p></li><li><p><a class=link href=https://www.happycow.net/reviews/green-point-cusco-39623 target=_blank rel=noopener>Green Point</a> - another amazing vegan restaurant in Cusco, you can also pick up very good pastries to go.</p></li></ul><h2 id=where-to-find-great-coffee>Where to find great coffee</h2><p>We only managed to find one spot worth mentioning, but this was our favourite cafe in all of Peru:</p><ul><li><a class=link href=https://florenciayfortunata.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Florencia y Fortuna</a> - this cafe is absolutely stunning and recently won the Coffee Design Award 2023. The mission of the cafe is to support women in the coffee industry, this starts from bean to cup. All coffee is purchased from woman-led farms and brewed by women in the case. There is an amazing selection of filter coffees to try here as well as amazing lunch options, <strong>do not miss</strong>.</li></ul></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/website/tags/peru/>Peru</a></section><section class=article-copyright><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentcolor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg><span>Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></section></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
