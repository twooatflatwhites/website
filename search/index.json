[{"content":"Arequipa is a stunning colonial city nestled in the Andes under the backdrop of Misti volcano. The Spanish influence here has influenced the city massively and is probably the most unique town we visited in Peru. We spent a few days wandering around this beautiful city and seeing what it had to offer.\nHow long to stay We\u0026rsquo;d recommend at least 2 days in the city, with a multi-day trip out to Colca Canyon (we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to do this unfortunately).\nWhat to do Santa Catalina Monastery - one of our favourite places in Arequipa, this monastery is still in use and has been preserved amazingly over the years. After you pay for entry, you can hire a guide inside the monastery which is highly recommended. It\u0026rsquo;s worth waiting for a few more people to join your guide as you will pay a cheaper price.\nPlaza de Armas - visit the main square in Arequipa, I guarantee you will be absolutely blown away. Surrounded by colonial buildings and headed by the Basilica cathedral. There are plenty of balconies to enjoy a coffee or beer and watch the world go by.\nRafting in Rio Chili - yep, colour me surprised too, but there is an amazing river just outside of the city to go rafting. This was my first time rafting and I had an absolute blast. The rafting we did here was level 3, so it was a reasonable challenge and had some really fun rapids to navigate.\nFree walking tour - take this free walking tour, there are departures at 10:00am, 15:00pm and 17:00pm every day in English. Our guide was fantastic and gave us a deep dive into the history and current state of Arequipa.\nColca Canyon - we didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time to get out to Colca Canyon as you definitely need to do a multi-day trip to make the 6 hour journey (one way) worth your time. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend getting a local tour company to take you for a minimum of two days.\nWhere to stay We stayed in Econunay hostel, social side wasn\u0026rsquo;t amazing but it did the job for a few days.\nWhere to eat Omphalos - we found ourselves here nearly every day, the food was really good and crazy cheap.\nPrana vegan club - great spot serving traditional Arequipan dishes, as well as burgers etc.\nEl Buda Profano - we heard amazing things about this place, but it appeared to be closed when we wanted to visit. Hopefully it opens up again soon!\nWhere to find great coffee Oso cafe - this was by far the best spot we found in Arequipa for a good coffee. The courtyard outside was a really nice spot for relaxing with a book.

Navigating the city by foot, we uncovered its charm and historical significance. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss Cristo Blanco for a stunning view, even if it takes a couple of attempts! üèûÔ∏èüåÑ\nThe journey The first thing when you arrive in Cusco is that you\u0026rsquo;re hit with altitude - it\u0026rsquo;s quite high here. We got into a taxi, arrived at our hostel and after climbing about 10 steps felt like we were going to faint. We have never felt like that before and it was hard to believe we would get used to it, but we did! We drank lots of coca tea which is made with coca leaves (which are the main ingredient of cocaine); this leaf is extremely important to Incan history and are sacred. It just makes you feel a bit more perky and helps with oxygen flow and therefore the altitude. You can drink it as tea or put leaves in your mouth to suck and get concentrated juice. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if it helps or if it\u0026rsquo;s psychological but it seemed to do us some good!\nHow long we stayed Depending on your time, you could spend anywhere from 3 days to 3 months in Cusco. We were in and around Cusco for just under 3 weeks, including our time out in Manu.\nWhat we did There\u0026rsquo;s so much to do in Cusco city and outside of the city so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to do absolutely everything, but here is what we got up to:\nManu National Park, the Amazon. If you have the time and budget, do not miss out on experiencing the Amazon. Cancelled plans in Ecuador due to some political issues there, led us to Bonanza; a family-run gem, where 25 years of passion for sustainable tourism won us over - they\u0026rsquo;re a bit more expensive than other companies but worth it in our opinion (and everyone else we recommended them to!); and we were extremely lucky to have the tour all to ourselves for 5 days! Our private jungle tour to Manu was a wild ride: a long drive through the cloud forest, a river boat adventure with a mid-journey river dip (no camens or piranhas here!), and a mesmerizing night on an observation deck surrounded by tapirs and the eerie calls of red howler monkeys. Jungle walks led us to massive monkey groups, insects, poisonous frogs, and countless birds. Surviving wasp encounters and a spiky fire bush added a touch of adventure. Sunset from an observation deck above the jungle canopy showcased more monkeys and birds before a freaky night walk to spot insects and reptiles. At sunrise we went back to the deck in search for macaws and toucans which proved successful, like it was orchestrated just for us. The return boat journey gifted us osprey sightings and refreshing river dips, thanks to the scorching heat.\nOur favorite jungle companions were the monkeys, traveling in massive groups with adorable babies clinging to them. However, Oropendulas unintentionally became our tour mascots, earning the title of \u0026ldquo;jungle pigeons\u0026rdquo; due to their omnipresence.\nAmidst hammock chill sessions, jungle hikes, and vegan feasts, the harsh reality of the Amazon\u0026rsquo;s challenges hit home. Laughter and wildlife wonders couldn\u0026rsquo;t drown out the echoes of chainsaws and jungle fires‚Äîa somber reminder of the urgent need to protect this beautiful place. Feeling extremely lucky and emotional, we cherished every moment of this extraordinary experience. üåøüêíüåÖ\nMachu Picchu. No Cusco list would be complete without the obligatory Machu Picchu recommendation. There are a miriad of ways to get to Machu Picchu, you could trek for 4 days on the Salkantay or Inca trail, but we opted to catch the train after exploring the Sacred Valley. We stayed in touristy Aguas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu the night before and after our visit. A thunderstorm hit, knocking out power and internet, but we were thankful to have our Machu Picchu tickets.\nWe opted for the bus instead of a sweaty walk up the stairs to Machu Picchu, grabbing a guide in town after a bit of bargaining. Expensive, but worth it for the site\u0026rsquo;s sparse information. Chose route 2 for both history and the iconic \u0026ldquo;Machu Picchu picture.\u0026rdquo; We learned that Machu Picchu\u0026rsquo;s preservation secret was locals hiding it from the Spanish. An American rediscovered it but stirred controversy by allegedly looting valuables. Designated a wonder in 2006, it\u0026rsquo;s a tad overpopulated but still impressively expected. The Andes stole the show with their breathtaking backdrop.\nDescending through the jungle-like hill, we even spotted the national bird of Peru, the cock of the rock. The next day, we relaxed in hot springs before the train and bus journey back to Cusco. üèûÔ∏èüöÇ\nSacred Valley. Explored the sacred valley, a hub of Inca history. In Chinchero, a traditional town known for its alpaca products, we marveled at the weaving process showcased in a museum. Eye-wateringly expensive, but the craftsmanship deserves it! Explored Moray, a surprising Inca \u0026ldquo;laboratory\u0026rdquo; with terraced levels for experimenting with light and altitude\u0026rsquo;s impact on plants. Other stops included Maras salt mine (bought fancy salt for our sad hostel meals)and Ollytaytambo. Moray stole the show with its innovative history.\nPalccoyo Rainbow Mountain. Do this instead of the Vinicunca rainbow mountain (the one everyone goes to); more rainbow mountains and less walking!. When we visited Palccoyo there were very few tourists there and we were treated to some incedible scenery. Otherworldly!\nLake Humantay. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t doing the Salkantay trek, then visiting Lake Humantay is a must. The lake is beautiful - you\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by snowcapped mountain and the lake itself is bright turquoise like nothing we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. We were also lucky enough to have condors flying above!\nLake Humantay is a glacier lake at an altitude of 4,600m meaning you need to complete a 300-400m climb at 4000m of elevation to see it, so bear that in mind! You can also grab a horse ride to the top if needed. We both found it quite challenging, but this was a particularly proud moment for Em who got pretty much all the way up there solo despite not being a hiker!\nExplore the city by foot. The city is best explored by foot and is a great way to acclimatise yourself. There\u0026rsquo;s charm around every corner in the city with plenty of independant artisanal shops, amazing restaraunts and narrow cobbly streets. We started with the usual walking tour to learn about the city - saw some ruins, got local insights on things to do and just generally learned about the history. Cusco was the capital and main centre point for the Incan empire so it holds a big significance - many of the buildings here are still in a traditional style of building.\nCristo Blanco. As you\u0026rsquo;re wandering around Cusco, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably notice the white Christ statue overlooking the city, you can actually walk up to Cristo Blanco and enjoy an amazing view over the city. It took us 3 attempts to get up here - not because we struggled with the climb, but because we firstly ran into a collapsed stairway that blocked our path (great start!) and then a paywall (not paying to see stones to get to big jesus oh hell no). We decided to hang about until sunset and go later on our third and successful try!\nWhere we stayed As we were moving in and out of Cusco, we stayed in a few places. Our favourite was The Bear Packer, great social environment here (it was like mini northern England!) with good facitilies. Think I remember it being pretty cheap too!\nWhere we ate As is seemingly common in Peru, you\u0026rsquo;re spoilt for choice:\nVida Vegan Bistro - whilst on the slight more expensive side, this is some of the best food we ate in all of Peru, highly recommended!\nGreen Falafel - really good, cheap falafel dishes here.\nIndian Restaurant Garhwal - we were absolutely not expecting to have Indian food this good in Peru, every dish was excellent.\nGreen Point - another amazing vegan restaurant in Cusco, you can also pick up very good pastries to go.\nWhere to find great coffee We only managed to find one spot worth mentioning, but this was our favourite cafe in all of Peru:\nFlorencia y Fortuna - this cafe is absolutely stunning and recently won the Coffee Design Award 2023. The mission of the cafe is to support women in the coffee industry, this starts from bean to cup. All coffee is purchased from woman-led farms and brewed by women in the case. There is an amazing selection of filter coffees to try here as well as amazing lunch options, do not miss.

Highlights include a walking tour in the historic center, a coastal stroll from Miraflores to Barranco for a sunset view at Lover\u0026rsquo;s Park, a street art hunt in Barranco with a visit to the Jade Rivera museum, indulging in traditional Peruvian dishes, a visit to the Larco Museum for pre-Colombian art and a unique sex exhibition, and the feline delights of Kennedy Park.üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåÖüç≤üèõÔ∏èüê±\nThe journey After 16 hours of travel, we arrived in Peru to start our journey. We are here! We arrived in Lima (via Bogota) and it all went pretty smooth: no delays, nothing forgotten, bags are in Lima etc! In a slight daze, we were both eager to get out and explore Lima, the entry point for most into Peru. From the second you leave the airport, there is the pure chaos of Latin America we experienced in Mexico - nothing and everything makes sense here; it\u0026rsquo;s pure explosion of people and sounds.\nHow long we stayed 3-4 nights is a good amount of time to explore Lima. We decided to slightly overstay our welcome just to get ourselves sorted and our heads into the South America time-zone!\nWhat we did There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to fill a few nights in Lima, here are some of our highlights:\nDo a walking tour around around the historic center. Most tours will begin in Miraflores and then teach you use the bus system as it\u0026rsquo;s a bit complicated (you need a special card) and quite far from Miraflores/Barranco; it would take over 2 hours to walk! It\u0026rsquo;s nice and worth doing, but not super exciting - a few statues and churches. It is however a great way to meet people - we met loads of people from our hostel who we became friends with and continued to hang out with.\nTake a stroll along the coast from Miraflores to Barranco. The evening is a good time for this so you can watch the sunset over the pacific coast - we did this on a walking tour and ended in Lover\u0026rsquo;s Park. Lover\u0026rsquo;s Park is a central point on the coast of Lima and has a huge statue of a couple embracing - it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be a good spot for romance but we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know about that\u0026hellip;\nSearch for street art in Barranco. We took ourselves for a walk around Barranco and when I say a walk I mean a coffee tour with some arty bits thrown in. We went to the mini Jade Rivera museum which we loved (he is a local graffiti artist). We bought a postcard with one of the pictures on of two kids with magnifying glasses and back packs ready to explore the universe; we chose this one because it felt poingyant for the beginning of our trip. We can\u0026rsquo;t wait to display it at home as a marker of our travels!\nTry some traditional Peruvian dishes. There are some incredible restaurants here; supposedly the best in the world?! The first thing you need to understand about Peruvians is that they LOVE sweet food - two of the main traditional foods to try is Picarones (donuts made with sweet potato and covered in syrup - Picarones Mary is apparently the best spot and was featured in a Netflix documentary) and drink Chicha Morada (a sweet juice made from purple corn - super refreshing on a warm day). Peru is also one of the biggest exporters of avocados - we lived the millenial dream e v e r y d a y. However, our favourite thing about Peru\u0026rsquo;s food was the link to China, meaning much of their traditional food is a fusion of Peru and China - Veggie lomo saltado was a core staple of our diet!\nVisit one of the best museums in South America and the world: The Larco museum. An amazing collection of pre-Colombian art - we usually struggle with museums but enjoyed this one! It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too long and there were interesting anthropological artifacts to look at over the Incan empire history. However, our two favourite things about it was the open storage collection (you never see this at any museum but it\u0026rsquo;s just insane to see how much they have that isn\u0026rsquo;t on display!) And the sex exhibition. Whilst it\u0026rsquo;s super entertaining how crude some of the artifacts are (massive dicks, blow jobs, anal‚Ä¶ you name it and there\u0026rsquo;s a statue of it), its also just great to see it\u0026rsquo;s not brushed over; in modern times we shy away from sex, but it was always so central to historical culture.\nKennedy Park (aka cat park). A park full of cats that are happy to be stroked, picked up and snuggled\u0026hellip; what more could you want? If you go at the right time in the evening you can watch them having dinner!\nWhere we stayed We really enjoyed Alpes Lima located in the Miraflores district, we found the hostel had a great social vibe as well as great facilities, we made a few friends here too. They helped us purchase a SIM card when we arrive which was really handy.\nWhere we ate There are a huge amount of great veggie/vegan restaraunts in Lima, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the chance to try them all unfortunately. The ones we did try were all excellent:\nAsianica Street Food - This was our favourite spot in Lima, everything we had was excellent and the menu consists of lots of vegan-ised traditional Peruvian dishes which we really wanted to try.\nFlorencia - Vegan Kitchen - Another great spot in Barranco, the portions were very generous too!\nSeitan Urban Bistro - Lots of traditional Peruvian dishes here made vegan!\nWhere to find great coffee There were four spots worth mentioning here that we tried:\nRaiz Coffee - Funnily enough this cafe opened opposite our hostel the day we arrived. The coffee here is fantastic and the owner is really friendly. We ended up spending hours in here chatting and reading our books.\nMilimertica Coffee - Awesome spot in Miraflores, great food options too if I remember rightly!\nCiclos Cafe - Voted the best cafe in Lima in 2022 and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why. An amazing selection of coffees on offer here tucked away in a really nice area of Barranco.\nCosmo Cafe - seemingly another new addition to the Lima coffee scene, we had an amazing cold brew here.\n","date":"2023-12-20T01:48:07Z","image":"https://twooatflatwhites.github.io/website/cover-lima.jpg","permalink":"https://twooatflatwhites.github.io/website/p/lima/","title":"Lima"}]
